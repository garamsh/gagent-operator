# Architecture

Current architecture of the system and the decisions behind it. This file is the index; workers read it before touching code, the PM keeps it honest.

## Structure

- **Responsibility documents** (one `.md` per domain or concern, e.g. `memory.md`, `gateway.md`) — the single source of truth for how the system is shaped *now*. To know the current state, read only these.
- **`adr/`** — the record of individual decisions: direction taken, context, rejected alternatives.

## Rules

1. **Responsibility document skeleton**: current decisions (consolidated) / rationale summary with links to the relevant ADRs / open questions. Do not copy ADR content — synthesize the present state.
2. **ADRs are append-only.** Once merged, the body is frozen. Exceptions: updating the status field (`accepted` → `superseded by ADR-XXXX`), and fixing typos or broken links. A changed decision means a new ADR that supersedes the old one — never an edit.
3. **Decisions land in pairs.** A PR that adds or supersedes an ADR must update the affected responsibility documents in the same PR. A PR with only one of the two is rejected — the final state must always live in the responsibility documents.
4. Keep this index current: every responsibility document and every ADR is listed here. An ADR covers a decision that changes a project rule — a settled choice that does not affect the rules does not earn one.
5. **Every domain or concern has a responsibility document.** The PR that introduces one adds its document; the PR that removes one deletes it. A system with no code yet has none, and that is the correct state.
